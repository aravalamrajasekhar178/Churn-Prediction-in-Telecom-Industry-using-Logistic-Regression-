Problem Statement :
According to European Business Review, telecommunication providers lose close to $65 million a month from customer churn. Isn't that 
expensive? With many emerging telecom giants, the competition in the telecom sector is increasing and the chances of customers discontinuing a 
service are high. This is often referred to as Customer Churn in Telecom. 
Telecommunication providers that focus on quality service, lower-cost 
subscription plans, availability of content and features whilst creating positive 
customer service experiences have high chances of customer retention. The 
good news is that all these factors can be measured with different layers of 
data about billing history, subscription plans, 
cost of content, network/bandwidth utilization, and more to get a 360-degree view of the 
customer. This 360-degree view of customer data can be leveraged for predictive analytics to identify patterns and various trends that influence 
customer satisfaction and help reduce churn in telecom. 

Steps performed in this project are :
•	Understanding Problem Statement
•	Data Cleaning : Removing unwanted columns and outliers which improves the model performance
•	Data Visualisation : Analysing the data through plots
•	Data Manipulation : Converting categorical variables into numerical variables
•	Feature Scaling : Converting all the variable values in particular range
•	Splitting the dataset into train & test data
•	Training the model using Logistic Regression
•	Evaluation of model performance by using confusion matrix
•	Finding the main reasons for the churn caused in Telecom Industry
